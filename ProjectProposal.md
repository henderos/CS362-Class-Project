## Product description

### <ins>Project Title</ins>

**Personal Finance Analyzer**


### <ins>Abstract</ins>

Personal Finance Analyzer is a web application designed to simplify financial management for users, providing tools to track spending and manage subscriptions. With an intuitive user interface and analytics, it aims to empower users to make informed financial decisions effortlessly.


### <ins>Goal</ins>

This project will help users to manage and keep track of their personal finances, see where their money is going, and make decisions for future spending based on these facts.


### <ins>Current Practice</ins>

Today, people commonly use spreadsheets, individual banking apps, or third-party apps to track their finances. These methods are often not automated, or if you have accounts in different banks, then you have to individually log into each banks’ account. With our web app, you will be able to link every account so that you can see everything in one spot with advanced features such as subscription tracking or personalized savings advice.


### <ins>Novelty</ins>

Our finance manager will not only allow users to see their finances, but also will tell users where certain “problem areas” may be, allowing them to see where they are likely able to improve.


### <ins>Effects</ins>

The people who will be using our web app are people who want to see all their financial information with a user-friendly interface. If we are successful in our app, our app will show more transparency with how our users' money is being handled. This will help reduce unnecessary expenses by identifying underused subscriptions and help users allocate their income effectively by highlighting spending patterns.


### <ins>Technical Approach</ins>

Our project will employ a scalable and efficient system architecture. The front end will be built using HTML and CSS, with JavaScript to enhance interactivity and responsiveness. For the back end, we will use Node.js with Express to handle server-side functionality and API routing. 
Data storage will be managed using MySQL to securely handle user information, while the Plaid API will enable integration with users’ bank accounts for retrieving financial data.


### <ins>Risks</ins>

One of the most significant challenges we face is ensuring effective and efficient communication within a large team. Miscommunication or delays in responding to inquiries could lead to misunderstandings, duplicated efforts, or even missed deadlines in some cases. Additionally, with multiple members handling interconnected tasks, it can be challenging to maintain a clear and cohesive understanding of project progress and priorities.

To mitigate this risk, we will establish clear communication expectations from the beginning. As mentioned above, team members will be required to regularly check Discord, our primary communication platform, and respond to messages within 17 hours. Tasks will be clearly assigned and tracked using GitHub Projects to provide transparency and accountability. Regular updates will be shared in designated channels to keep everyone informed of ongoing progress.
