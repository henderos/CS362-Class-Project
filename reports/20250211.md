**Progress:**

**Issues:**
  - For the database, we are unsure about the longevity. At the moment, one of the members is hosting on the Google Cloud server, but might need to transition to hosting the server locally due to costs.

  - Front End:  
  
  - Back End: Make it so that when we get the JSON file from Plaid, for that data to be occupied in our database.
